title: "Computing is Essential for the Future of Physics Education"
date: "2025-04-11"
abstract: "Computing is central to the enterprise of physics. It is used to model physical systems, to perform analyses of data, and to control and monitor experiments. And while computing is used widely in physics, across the sciences, and in engineering, it has been a incredible community effort to integrate computing into the undergraduate physics curriculum. Over the last decade, physicists, physics educators, and physics education researchers have worked together to develop a community devoted to integrating computing in many aspects of physics education and to develop resources that support this substantive change. Alongside the professional development of faculty and construction of curricular materials, physics education researchers have studied the methods and impacts of these and other efforts. In this talk, I will trace the history and development on computing in physics education, discuss the present state of the field, and share some of the necessary conversations needed to continue to ensure physics education is prepared for the future."
