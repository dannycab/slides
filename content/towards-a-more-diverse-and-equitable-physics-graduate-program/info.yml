title: "Towards a more diverse and equitable physics graduate program"
date: "2021-11-23"
abstract: "Physics departments have a moral imperative to address the historical and continued systemic inequities in our community. Women, people of color, LBGTQIA+ folks, veterans, persons with disabilities, and those who hold intersecting identities from those communities are not well-represented in physics programs or as graduates of physics programs. This is a complex issue, but we can point to research that indicates that, in many cases, the culture of physics excludes those folks from participating. While there are many places where we can effect change, our work has focused on graduate physics programs. At Michigan State University (MSU), we have begun a conscious effort to reconstruct our graduate physics program with an eye towards a more supportive and inclusive program. In this talk, we will situate our efforts in the larger narrative of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM while presenting the specific changes that we have made to the MSU admissions process. Our research and development efforts include investigations into patterns of admission including how our rubric-based holistic review process has affected those patterns. Our work has focused on the graduate admissions process, but we are actively working to effect change in the graduate program itself.  This work has been supported by MSUâ€™s College of Natural Science and the Lappan-Phillips Foundation."
