# Project Goals

- to **improve the undergraduate physics curriculum** by implementing the American Physical Society (APS) and American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) curricular recommendations through a **vibrant, supportive community-building effort**;
- to **develop the PICUP Resources Archive and Exercise Sets Collection** beyond their fledgling state into a widely-used resource that will **impact undergraduate physics curricula nationwide**; and
- to **develop a series of evidence-based lessons, guides, and instructional aids** that support a variety of assessment practices and approaches for computational physics learning.
