# Setting and Sharing Individual Goals

<div class="twocolumns">

<img src="./images/organizing-framework.png" alt="Organizing Framework">

- Take 5-10 minutes to develop a set of goals for yourself in at least two of the three areas.
- Post your ideas to the [Discussion Board](https://www.compadre.org/PICUP/events/SLICE2025/?T=Discussion).

- *Example*:<br>I have a fairly complete classical mechanics course written as a JupyterBook.<br>I want to work with people on how to take those materials and make them most useful for the community.
