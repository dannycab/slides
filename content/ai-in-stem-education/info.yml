title: "AI in STEM Education: Because Everyone Else Is Doing It2025 PICUP SLICE Debrief"
date: "2025-10-19"
abstract: "AI has become the latest must-have in STEM education. From integrating generative AI tools and chatbots that promise “efficiency” while draining energy and dodging labor, to machine learning and deep learning courses that offer genuine disciplinary value, the terrain is uneven and poorly mapped. This talk disentangles the many meanings of “AI” in STEM: a tool integrated into courses, an enabling idea for STEM research, a research agenda in education, and a societal force that will affect us all. We'll examine how AI is reshaping curriculum and pedagogy in science and computing, how it's being studied (and sold), and why general education must confront its broader implications — including its entanglement with extractive, exploitative, and invasive systems. As institutions rush to adopt AI “because everyone else is doing it,” we must ask: What are we teaching, who benefits, and what futures are we enabling? AI in STEM Education is not just about innovation — it's about intention."
