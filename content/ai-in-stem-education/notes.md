Absolutely, Danny — this is a rich and timely presentation, and your outline already has a strong foundation. Let’s work on deepening the structure, clarifying the narrative arc, and crafting a compelling endpoint. I’ll break this down into three parts:

---

## 🧭 1. **Organizing the Story: Narrative Arc**

To make the talk more engaging and coherent, consider this **three-act structure**:

### **Act I: Orientation & Provocation**
- **Goal**: Establish credibility, provoke curiosity, and frame the problem.
- **Content**:
  - Who you are and why this matters to you.
  - The disclaimer and the multiplicity of AI meanings.
  - The provocative question: *“What are we teaching, who benefits, and what futures are we enabling?”*
  - Brief history and evolution of AI — not just technical, but social and labor-related.

### **Act II: Mapping the Terrain**
- **Goal**: Show the complexity and unevenness of AI in STEM education.
- **Content**:
  - Disentangle the forms of AI and their educational implications.
  - Use the four-part framework (about, with, to use, against) to structure this.
  - Highlight real examples from CMSE and physics.
  - Emphasize the need for precision and context — “One size does not fit all.”

### **Act III: Response & Responsibility**
- **Goal**: Offer a vision for intentional, critical, and inclusive AI education.
- **Content**:
  - Showcase CMSE 101 and its clastic approach.
  - Revisit the four-part framework with emphasis on general education.
  - Call to action: intentionality over innovation, criticality over compliance.
  - End with a reflection on futures: *What kind of STEM education do we want to build?*

## 🧱 2. **Deepening Slide Ideas**

Here are some suggestions to enrich each section with visuals, examples, and provocations:

### **Introduction**
- Slide: A collage of AI headlines (“AI will change everything!” / “AI is dangerous!” / “AI is just statistics!”)
- Slide: Your career timeline with key moments intersecting with AI.

### **What is AI?**
- Slide: Timeline of AI milestones with labor and environmental annotations.
- Slide: Diagram of AI types (ML, DL, RNNs, Transformers) with use cases.
- Slide: “AI is not magic” — limitations and narrowness.

### **Forms of AI in Education**
- Slide: Matrix of spaces × educational approaches (e.g., robotics × “learning to use AI”)
- Slide: Aman Yadav’s framework with examples from MSU.
- Slide: PICUP quote — “One size does not fit all” — with a visual of diverse classrooms.

### **Teaching/Learning Examples**
- Slide: CMSE program overview with arrows showing curriculum evolution.
- Slide: CMSE 101 vs CMSE 201/202 — contrasting goals and audiences.
- Slide: HiTA architecture (RAG model) and student interaction flow.
- Slide: GenAI prompting activity — show student outputs and reflections.

### **Critical AI Education**
- Slide: “AI is not a neutral good” — show examples of surveillance, bias, exploitation.
- Slide: CMSE 101 goals — conceptual, personal, critical.
- Slide: Independent media sources used (404 Media, Paris Marx) — logos and quotes.

## 🎯 3. **Crafting the Endpoint**

You want to leave the audience with a sense of **urgency, agency, and possibility**. Here’s a suggested closing structure:

### **Final Slide: “Because Everyone Else Is Doing It…”**
- Reframe the title: *“If everyone else is doing it, what are we doing differently?”*
- Pose three final questions:
  1. What kind of AI education do we want to build?
  2. Who is included in that future?
  3. What values will guide us?

### **Optional Closing Quote**
> “The future is not something we enter. The future is something we create.” — Leonard Sweet

Would you like help turning this into a slide deck structure (titles, visuals, speaker notes)? Or would you prefer a script-style narrative to accompany the slides?


# **AI in STEM Education: Because Everyone Else Is Doing It**

## 🧭 Narrative Structure: Three Acts

---

## **Act I: The Mirage of AI in STEM — What Are We Actually Talking About?**

### **1. Opening Provocation**
- Slide: Headlines and hype — “AI will revolutionize education!” vs “AI is surveillance capitalism!”
- Personal intro: DC’s labor trajectory, disciplinary commitments, and positionality.
- Disclaimer: This is not institutional policy — it’s a critical reflection from within the system.

### **2. Disentangling AI**
- Slide: “AI ≠ One Thing” — show a taxonomy:
  - **Generative AI** (LLMs, image generators)
  - **Machine Learning** (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
  - **Deep Learning** (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
  - **Symbolic AI** (expert systems, logic-based)
  - **AI as Infrastructure** (data pipelines, surveillance, cloud labor)

### **3. Historical & Material Context**
- Slide: Timeline of AI development with overlays of:
  - Labor exploitation (clickwork, ghost labor, data labeling)
  - Environmental cost (training emissions, data center energy)
  - Military and surveillance entanglements
- Slide: “AI is not just tech — it’s a socio-technical system”

### **4. Framing Questions**
- What are we teaching?
- Who benefits?
- What futures are we enabling?

## **Act II: The Fractured Terrain — AI in STEM Education Today**

### **1. Four Educational Orientations Toward AI**  
*(Adapted from Aman Yadav, expanded)*

| Orientation | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **About AI** | Conceptual, historical, ethical understanding | CMSE 101, Gen Ed |
| **With AI** | Using AI tools to support learning | HiTA, autograding |
| **To Use AI** | Technical training in AI development | CMSE 201/202, DS major |
| **Against AI** | Critical resistance, ethical interrogation | CMSE 101, media literacy |

### **2. Disciplinary Specificity**
- Slide: “One Size Does Not Fit All” — PICUP quote
- Physics: ML for modeling, but needs conceptual scaffolding
- CS: Often assumes technical fluency, lacks critical framing
- Data Science: Positioned to integrate all four orientations

### **3. Institutional Pressures**
- Slide: “Everyone Else Is Doing It” — adoption driven by:
  - Market forces
  - Student demand
  - Administrative mandates
  - Tech vendor lobbying

### **4. Curriculum Case Studies**
- CMSE 201/202: Prompting, GenAI, neural networks
- CMSE Grad Program: ML/DL research, ethics modules
- Physics: PICUP, computing integration, ML for modeling
- CMSE 101: Clastic approach — critical + classical

- Slide: CMSE 101 goals
  - Conceptual literacy
  - Critical media analysis
  - Ethical reasoning
  - Personal reflection
