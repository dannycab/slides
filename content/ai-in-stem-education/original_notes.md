## Abstract

AI has become the latest must-have in STEM education. From integrating generative AI tools and chatbots that promise “efficiency” while draining energy and dodging labor, to machine learning and deep learning courses that offer genuine disciplinary value, the terrain is uneven and poorly mapped. This talk disentangles the many meanings of “AI” in STEM: a tool integrated into courses, an enabling idea for STEM research, a research agenda in education, and a societal force that will affect us all. We’ll examine how AI is reshaping curriculum and pedagogy in science and computing, how it’s being studied (and sold), and why general education must confront its broader implications — including its entanglement with extractive, exploitative, and invasive systems. As institutions rush to adopt AI “because everyone else is doing it,” we must ask: What are we teaching, who benefits, and what futures are we enabling? AI in STEM Education is not just about innovation — it’s about intention.

## Outline

### Introduction to me; disclaimer

- Who is DC? 
    - Career and labor trajectory
    - Why listen to me?
- Disclaimer: don't represent MSU, colleges, etc. - not to be provocative, but because there's many views on AI and mine are my own.
    - We are actively working on these issues and things will be different tomorrow.
- There are many forms of AI and we must disentangle them to ensure we understand each other
    - I will define in a moment, and some of you might know this already...and better than me.
    - In thinking about these frames of AI, consider: What are we teaching, who benefits, and what futures are we enabling?

### What do we mean by AI? A brief history

#### Milestones in computing and AI 
 - (tech, labor, use cases)
 - Computing -> AI 

#### Timeline/Phase space of forms of AI 
 - (Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning; Recurrent Neural Networks; Transformers)
 
#### Labor in AI
 - emphasis on AI and outside labor

#### Environmental concerns in AI
 - differences in processes and power

#### Continued Limitations of AI technologies
 - talk about issues with training and data, narrow tasks, etc.

#### What are we teaching, who benefits, and what futures are we enabling?

### What is the challenge ahead of us as educators? Different forms of AI in different spaces

#### Spaces

- Research, data analysis, and modeling
- Control systems, robotics, and industrial applications
- Translation, language analysis, and text processing
- Information gathering, surveillance, and targeting
- As of yet developed spaces (requires a nimbleness)

#### Educating

- Teaching/Learning about AI
- Teaching/Learning with AI
- Teaching/Learning to use AI
- Teaching/Learning against AI

-- *Borrowed from Aman Yadav*

#### Precision is important

- What kind of AI? For what purpose? With what goals?

**One size does not fit all.** - PICUP research

*But, we can develop a model (a framework) that's applicable in different contexts*

### How might we respond? Ideas for a comprehensive understanding

We are going to have to make decisions about how to do this work. I'll speak from my perspective as someone in STEM Education.

- Teaching/Learning about AI (STEM majors, *General Ed*)
- Teaching/Learning with AI (Tools we are using)
- Teaching/Learning to use AI (STEM Majors)
- Teaching/Learning against AI (STEM majors, *General Ed*)

### Teaching/Learning about AI (STEM majors, *General Ed*)

#### AI STEM Majors Story

- Present CMSE DS program; focus on computing/math (forms of AI!)
- Present CMSE grad program; coursework and research
- Highlight LGs, pedagogical models, and continuous curriculum
- Dive into CMSE 201/202 and how they need to adapt (neural networks and ML)
    - CODE Grade tool (no AI yet)
- What does this enable; talk about impact on college and physics department
    - Research enabled: DS identity, use of tech, grading and feedback
- Side story: Physics integrating computing; PICUP; community of support needs to develop, etc.
    - Physics informed ML and other analyses for Physics??? Other science use?
- What is the role of our teaching general education here? Overview of plans and discussion happening now at MSU


*Make sure to disentangle forms of AI here*

### Teaching/Learning with AI (Tools we are using)

- Skepticism about using these tools; what problems do they propose to solve?
- Learning is social and situated as we are human, we do use tools to learn and work with things
- Some there might be places for forms of AI (examples!) - student-facing, admin-facing, instructor-facing
- HiTA (a RAG model system) - what is a RAG?
    - What happens with it and how do students use it?
    - Research into their use
- Highlights from other places (using AI to solve disciplinary problems and enable autograding; Gerd ++)
    - Why? Maybe we are not asking good questions? (3DL work; highlight Melanie's work; Kevin's?)

### Teaching/Learning to use AI (STEM Majors)

- AI analyses - reminder of DS major; research, grad courses
- GenAI
    - In courses like CMSE 201/202, models of use and approach
        - Real activity with discussion of prompting (leads to this course)
    - In disciplinary courses, other models (CM story; adoption of discussion by others)
        - CM is taken after 201, so students have had prompting discussion (reminder and so on)
        - Review of projects and reporting

### Teaching/Learning against AI (*General Ed*)

- AI is not a neutral good
- Students should develop a personal, conceptual, and critical understanding of AI
- Describe CMSE 101 (disciplinary focus vs broad instruction)
