# What has happened?

## The president has issued and his administration are attempting to enforce several executive orders:

* Cancellation of anything DEI related
* Federal freeze on grants and loans; cuts to current NIH and NSF grants
* Stoppage of work at US AID, CPB, and other federal agencies
* Reversal of Title IX protections for women and LGBTQ+ individuals
* And so much more...

## These executive orders are callous, cruel, and dangerous.

---

# A few things to remember

* You are not alone in any of your feelings; we are all in this together
* You don't have to agree with everything I say to be a part of this community; you are welcome here
* You don't have to do anything I suggest; but it would be sweet if you did

## Our collective power is our greatest strength

---

# Attacks on women, folks of color, the LGBTQ+ community, and immigrants are attacks on all of us

## We must stand together to resist these attacks

# Interactions with Law Enforcement

If you are approached by law enforcement, you have the right to remain silent

* You do not have to answer any questions
* You do not have to show ID
* You do not have to consent to a search
* You do not have to open your door
* You do not have to do anything without a **warrant signed by a judge**

Cops are very good at getting you to talk to them. They are seeking your consent to search you, your car, your home, etc.

## "I don't have anything to say. I want to speak to a lawyer."

---

# Know that some of us avoid interactions with law enforcement because we have been taught to

* My experience is not yours and yours is not mine
* We all have different experiences with law enforcement
* Some of your friends might be incredibly uncomfortable around law enforcement
