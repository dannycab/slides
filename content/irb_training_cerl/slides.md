# Why do we have IRB training?

- Take a few minutes and read this section of the Wikipedia article on IRBs:
  - [Institutional Review Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board#United_States_mandate_for_IRBs)
- Once you have read it, take a few minutes to discuss with your neighbor:
  - Why do we have IRB training?
  - What is the purpose of the IRB?
- After a few minutes, we will discuss as a group.

# What is the IRB?
- Reviews research proposals for ethical standards
- Protects the rights and welfare of human subjects
- Required by federal law for research involving people
- Ensures compliance with ethical principles and regulations
- Minimizes risks and maximizes benefits to participants
- Respects the rights and dignity of all participants

# Why did we develop Institutional Review Boards?

IRBs were created in response to serious ethical violations in research during the 20th century, such as:

- [Tuskegee Syphilis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study)
- [Milgram Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)
- [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment)
- [Willowbrook Hepatitis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook_State_School#Hepatitis_studies)

These and other cases around the world highlighted the need to protect human subjects in research.

# For university research, there are documents that govern our research efforts:

- [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html) outlines ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects.
- [The Common Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/index.html) establishes the basic provisions for IRBs, informed consent, and assurances of compliance.
- [The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) protects the privacy of student education records.
- [The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) protects the privacy and security of health information.

# We mostly focus on FERPA and Common Rule

- FERPA protects the privacy of student education records, including grades, transcripts, and other personally identifiable information.
- The Common Rule establishes the basic provisions for IRBs, informed consent, and assurances of compliance.
- The IRB ensures that research involving students complies with FERPA and the Common Rule.

# What is the IRB process?

- **Proposal Submission**: Submit research plan with methods and participant details
- **Review**: IRB evaluates proposal for ethical standards and compliance
- **Approval**: Begin study if approved; revise if feedback provided
- **Monitoring**: Ongoing oversight ensures continued compliance
- **Reporting**: Report adverse events and study changes to IRB
- **Renewal**: Reapply for approval after expiration period

---

# What are the different determinations?

- **Not Human Subjects Research**: No IRB review needed; does not involve human subjects.
- **Exempt**: Minimal risk research; simplified review process.
- **Expedited**: Minimal risk research; faster review process.
- **Full Board Review**: Higher risk research; requires full IRB review and approval.

Our work is typically "not human subjects research" or "exempt".

---

# What is the IRB looking for?
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential risks to participants
- **Informed Consent**: Ensure participants understand study and risks
- **Confidentiality**: Protect participant data and privacy
- **Recruitment**: Fair and equitable participant selection
- **Data Management**: Secure data storage and handling

---

# What forms do we use? What are they for?

- **IRB Application Form**: Initial proposal submission
- **HRP-503** Protocol Form: Detailed research plan
- **HRP-512** Determination Form: Determine if research is human subjects research
- **HRP-511** (sometimes for grants): 45 CFR 46.118 Determination

---

# What do you need to include in your IRB application?

- **Purpose**: Explain the research objectives and significance
- **Methods**: Detailed description of research design and procedures
- **Participants**: Inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment methods
- **Risks**: Identify potential risks and how they will be minimized
- **Benefits**: Describe potential benefits to participants and society

---

# What do you need to include in your IRB application? (cont.)

- **Informed Consent**: Explain how participants will be informed and consent obtained
- **Data Management**: Describe how data will be collected, stored, and protected
- **Timeline**: Estimated duration of the study and participant involvement
- **Funding**: Source of funding and any conflicts of interest

---

# What documents do you typically need to create?
- **Informed Consent Form**: Outlines study details, risks, benefits, and participant rights
- **Recruitment Materials**: Flyers, emails, or other materials used to recruit participants
- **Data Collection Instruments**: Surveys, questionnaires, or other tools used to collect data

---

# What are some common mistakes in IRB applications?

- **Incomplete Information**: Missing details about methods, risks, or participant rights
- **Vague Language**: Lack of clarity in describing procedures or risks
- **Inadequate Risk Assessment**: Failing to identify or address potential risks
- **Insufficient Informed Consent**: Not providing enough information for participants to make an informed decision
- **Poorly Defined Recruitment**: Unclear or unfair recruitment methods
- **Lack of Data Security**: Not addressing how participant data will be protected
