# Why do we have IRB training?

- Take a few minutes and read this section of the Wikipedia article on IRBs:
  - [Institutional Review Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board#United_States_mandate_for_IRBs)
- Once you have read it, take a few minutes to discuss with your neighbor:
  - Why do we have IRB training?
  - What is the purpose of the IRB?
- After a few minutes, we will discuss as a group.

# What is the IRB?
- Reviews research proposals for ethical standards
- Protects the rights and welfare of human subjects
- Required by federal law for research involving people
- Ensures compliance with ethical principles and regulations
- Minimizes risks and maximizes benefits to participants
- Respects the rights and dignity of all participants

# Why did we develop Institutional Review Boards?

IRBs were created in response to serious ethical violations in research during the 20th century, such as:

- [Tuskegee Syphilis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study)
- [Milgram Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)
- [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment)
- [Willowbrook Hepatitis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook_State_School#Hepatitis_studies)

These and other cases around the world highlighted the need to protect human subjects in research.

# For university research, there are documents that govern our research efforts:

- [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html) outlines ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects.
- [The Common Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/common-rule/index.html) establishes the basic provisions for IRBs, informed consent, and assurances of compliance.
- [The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) protects the privacy of student education records.
- [The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) protects the privacy and security of health information.

# For education research we mostly focus on FERPA and Common Rule

- FERPA protects the privacy of student education records, including grades, transcripts, and other personally identifiable information.
- The Common Rule establishes the basic provisions for IRBs, informed consent, and assurances of compliance.
- The IRB ensures that research involving students complies with FERPA and the Common Rule.

# What is the IRB process?

- **Proposal Submission**: Researchers submit a proposal to the IRB detailing the research plan, including methods, participant recruitment, and data collection.
- **Review**: The IRB reviews the proposal to ensure it meets ethical standards and complies with regulations.
- **Approval**: If the proposal is approved, researchers can begin their study. If not, the IRB provides feedback for revisions.
- **Monitoring**: The IRB monitors ongoing research to ensure compliance with ethical standards and regulations.
- **Reporting**: Researchers must report any adverse events or changes to the study to the IRB.
- **Renewal**: IRB approval is typically valid for a given period of time, after which researchers must submit a renewal application.
