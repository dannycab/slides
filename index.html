                    <div class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Computing is central to the enterprise of physics. It is used to model physical systems, to perform analyses of data, and to control and monitor experiments. And while computing is used widely in physics, across the sciences, and in engineering, it has been a incredible community effort to integrate computing into the undergraduate physics curriculum. Over the last decade, physicists, physics educators, and physics education researchers have worked together to develop a community devoted to integrating computing in many aspects of physics education and to develop resources that support this substantive change. Alongside the professional development of faculty and construction of curricular materials, physics education researchers have studied the methods and impacts of these and other efforts. In this talk, I will trace the history and development on computing in physics education, discuss the present state of the field, and share some of the necessary conversations needed to continue to ensure physics education is prepared for the future.</div>

                    <div class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Computing has revolutionized how modern science is done. Modern scientists use computational techniques to reduce mountains of data, to simulate impossible experiments, and to develop intuition about the behavior of complex systems. Much of the research completed by modern scientists would be impossible without the use of computing. And yet, while computing is a crucial tool of practicing scientists, most modern science curricula do not reflect its importance and utility. In this talk, I will discuss the urgent need to construct such curricula in physics and present research that investigates the challenges at a variety of all scales from the largest (institutional structures) to the smallest (student understanding of a concept). I will discuss how the results of this research can be leveraged to facilitate the computational revolution in science education. This research will help us understand and develop institutional incentives, effective teaching practices, evidence-based course activities, and valid assessment tools.

                    <div class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Physics departments have a moral imperative to address the historical and continued systemic inequities in our community. Women, people of color, LBGTQIA+ folks, veterans, persons with disabilities, and those who hold intersecting identities from those communities are not well-represented in physics programs or as graduates of physics programs. This is a complex issue, but we can point to research that indicates that, in many cases, the culture of physics excludes those folks from participating. While there are many places where we can effect change, our work has focused on graduate physics programs. At Michigan State University (MSU), we have begun a conscious effort to reconstruct our graduate physics program with an eye towards a more supportive and inclusive program. In this talk, we will situate our efforts in the larger narrative of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in STEM while presenting the specific changes that we have made to the MSU admissions process. Our research and development efforts include investigations into patterns of admission including how our rubric-based holistic review process has affected those patterns. Our work has focused on the graduate admissions process, but we are actively working to effect change in the graduate program itself.
